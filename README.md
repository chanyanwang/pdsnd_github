### Project Title
Bike Share

### Description
In this project, we will 
1. make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
2. write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
3. also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The CSV files and code file are
1. chicago.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. washington.csv 
4. bikeshare.py 
	
### Credits
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, 
though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. 
These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, 
to uncover bike share usage patterns.
